# 📜 About
Created a client-side React app to visualize pathfinding algorithms. It was conceived as a fun and interactive way to deepen my knowledge in these areas. As my exploration of graph algorithms continues, I plan to incorporate them.

# 🔜 Future Implementations
- Integrate additional pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra’s and A*.
- Plan to deploy the application on GitHub Pages for wider access.
