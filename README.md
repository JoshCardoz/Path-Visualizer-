# 🌐 About
This React application provides a visual representation of various pathfinding algorithms. Designed as an enjoyable medium to enhance my understanding of graph and pathfinding algorithms, it serves as both an educational tool and an ongoing project. As I delve deeper into graph algorithms, I continue to integrate them into the application.

# ⏳ Future Implementations
- 🛤️ Integrate additional pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra’s and A*.
- 🚀 Deployment to GitHub Pages for wider accessibility.
